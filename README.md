# AI Agents Bootcamp (7-Day Crash Course)

This repository contains my implementation of the **AI Agents Crash Course** by Alexey Grigorev.  
The goal is to build a practical AI Agent capable of autonomously working with documentation, context, and retrieval.

I am completing this bootcamp in parallel with the **AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp** to reinforce applied skills and concepts.
